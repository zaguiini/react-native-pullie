## ü§î What on earth is that?

This is a fully customizable pull-from-bottom-view, useful for displaying extra information on the screen without having to worry too much about space.

## üìñ Installation

**NOTE: REACT-NATIVE >= 0.59.0 REQUIRED. We're usingHooks()!**

`yarn add react-native-pullie`

## üí° Minimum usage Example

```js
import React from 'react'
import { View, Text } from 'react-native'
import Pullie from 'react-native-pullie'

function MyView() {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = React.useState(false)

  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      {/* my content... */}
      <Pullie
        isOpen={isOpen}
        setIsOpen={setIsOpen}
        teaser={
          <View style={{ height: 70 }}>
            <Text>Drag me</Text>
          </View>
        }
        teaserHeight={70}
      >
        <View>
          <Text>Hey there!</Text>
        </View>
      </Pullie>
    </React.Fragment>
  )
}
```

As you can see, it's a controlled component: it only opens if you want to and you close it programmatically (using context, for example).

## üò≥ Known issues / TODO

- the backdrop suddenly disappears on click instead of fading out gracefully;
- it's boring to specify a teaser height, maybe use the `onLayout` callback to measure it;
- make an uncontrolled version.
